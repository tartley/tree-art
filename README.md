# Tree art

## Ideas

* Take a seed for repeatability
* Try random.uniform
* Try random.triangular
* Why is there not an open triangle of sky at each junction? Turn on outline,
  different colors for each iteration, try fill="none" or "invis" or reverse order of drawing.
* It's slow to generate and render. Can we join up the drawn entities into fewer, more complex
  polygons, to speed it up? (And reduce filesize?)
* Is it worth trying alt SVG generation libraries?
* Add a ground
* Add other branches
* Add a forest?
  * greyer trees receding into the distance
  * occasional white beech trees?
