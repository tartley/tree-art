# Tree art

## Ideas

* It's slow to generate and render. Can we join up the drawn entities into
  fewer, more complex polygons, to speed it up? (And reduce filesize?)
* Is it worth trying alt SVG generation libraries?
* Add a ground
* Add other branches
* Add a forest?
  * greyer trees receding into the distance
  * occasional white beech trees?
